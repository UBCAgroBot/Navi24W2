# Navi24W2
Navigation's 2024 term 2 work.

The goal for this term is to explore reactive, SLAM, and maybe deep learning for navigation.


### Past work:

Hough algorithm

CenterRowAlgorithm

### Future work:  

Bug algorithm:  
 - This seems very good for Task 1, making turns around crop rows will be a challenge 
   though  

Potential Field Algorithm:  
 - This seems very good for Task 1. How can we place attracting forces to guide the
   robot around crop rows?  

Random Tree Algorithm (RRT/RRT*):  
 - This one looks useful for exploring an unknown area for weeds, ie Task 3 for FRE.  
 - I do not understand how you would actually apply this without spending 90% of 
   the time backtracking to a previous node or only expanding a time step from the 
   current node. What are the implications of only expanding from the current node?

### FRE Resources
FRE resouces can be suprisingly elusive so if you find anything interesting put it here.
