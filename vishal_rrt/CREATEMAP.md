# Maze Generator using Depth-First Search Algorithm

This Python script generates a maze using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm and visualizes it using OpenCV. The maze is represented as a grid where `1` represents a wall and `0` represents a free space.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
